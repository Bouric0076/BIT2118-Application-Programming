## **üìú Assignment Questions & Solutions**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Game Program (`question-one` Branch)**  
- The user enters the number of rounds to play.  
- For each round, they enter a lucky number.  
- The program checks if the remainder (lucky number √∑ secret number) is:  
  - `0` ‚Üí **Draw** (+1 point)  
  - **Even number** ‚Üí **Win** (+3 points)  
  - **Odd number** ‚Üí **Loss** (-3 points)  
- At the end, it determines if the player **won, lost, or drew**.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Pattern Printing (`pattern-program` Branch)**  
- Uses **nested loops** to print a structured pattern.  
- The diagonal contains `&`, while the rest are `*`.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Credit Worthiness Check (`credit-check` Branch)**  
- Reads **credit limit**, **price**, and **quantity** of items.  
- If the total cost exceeds the limit, the user must re-enter the quantity.  
- Displays an appropriate message based on whether the purchase is allowed.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Area Calculator (`area-calc` Branch)**  
- The user selects a **triangle, rectangle, or circle**.  
- The program calculates the area based on user input.  
- Allows the user **three attempts** in case of an invalid selection.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Sales Report (`question-5` Branch)**  
- Stores sales data for **10 salesmen** selling **5 different items**.  
- Uses **arrays** to calculate:  
  - **Each salesman‚Äôs total sales**  
  - **Grand total sales**  
- Displays the report in a tabular format.
